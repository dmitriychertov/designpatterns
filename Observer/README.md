Observer Design Pattern in Java
==============
What is Observer Design Pattern in Java ?. The Gang of Four book (Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, 1995, Pearson Education, Inc. Publishing as Pearson Addison Wesley) says that the Observer design pattern should "Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically." Example : Let's say there is Weather Broadcasting company which broadcast weather changes to its subscribers. The subscribers or observers such as News Channels , News Paper Agencies and Weather Information Provider websites etc ... gets updated as soon as weather changes by the Weather Broadcasting company. Let's see how we can implement this Subject - Observer model in Java.
